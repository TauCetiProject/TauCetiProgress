"""What actually landed in a window, established from git and the published documentation.

This module exists because of a specific failure mode. PR descriptions in this project are good, but
they are *self-reported*: an author writes "this PR proves Cauchy's integral formula" and the
description is what a reporting model would otherwise read. A description can overstate, can be
edited after the fact, and -- since anyone may open a PR -- can contain text written to steer a
model. A report built from descriptions alone can announce a headline theorem the merged diff does
not contain.

The ground truth is assembled from two authorities, neither of which requires understanding Lean:

* **doc-gen4** says which declarations exist, what they are called, what kind they are, which page
  documents them, what their docstrings say, and exactly which file and lines define them. It
  computes that from the elaborated environment, which is the only way to get it right; see
  `docs.py` for why a text scanner cannot, and for the facts bundle it is read from.
* **git blame** says who wrote those lines. A declaration belongs to this window when the commits
  that wrote its defining lines are in the window. That is an exact question with an exact answer.
