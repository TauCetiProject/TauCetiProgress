"""The two generated file formats, and the validators the merge gate runs on them.

`STATUS.md` is a snapshot: rewritten whole on every update, headed by the commit it describes.
`PROGRESS.md` is an append-only log of windows, each section headed by the commit range it covers.

Both carry a machine-readable HTML-comment header followed by prose, following the
`tauceti-<kind>:v1 {json}` convention the rest of the project already uses for scoreboards and
target markers. A `STATUS.md` may carry a second header, `tauceti-coverage:v1`: the report's
verdict on each layer of the roadmap (done, partial, untouched, or unassessed when the material
says nothing), with what remains, in a form a script can read. Its prose says the same things;
the marker exists so that forty roadmaps' worth of them can be put on one page (the TauCeti site's
Progress page) without a person re-reading every report. It has exactly the standing of the prose
beside it: a model's account, not security-validated, and never a claim Lean has checked.

Everything here is pure: it takes and returns text, touches no network and no filesystem. That
matters because the merge gate in CI runs these same functions on an untrusted PR's blobs, and it
is the only thing standing between a model and a human-owned repository. The gate proves *shape*,
never truth -- see the trust-boundary section of README.md.
