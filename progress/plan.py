"""The decision: is an update due, which roadmap does it cover, and which PRs are in the window.

Everything here is script logic. No model is started until this has produced a plan, which is the
design rule for the whole tool: the parts that can be decided mechanically are decided
mechanically, and the model is left with prose.

Two thresholds, both overridable so they can be raised as the project grows:

* `IDLE_HOURS` -- an update is due only if *no* area has been updated for this long. This paces the
  whole project as a whole rather than per area: at 8 hours, about three reports a day across
  fourteen roadmaps.
* `MIN_PRS` -- the winning area must have at least this many PRs in its window. Without a floor, a
  quiet day produces a padded report about three commits.

Both belong to the default strategy, `busiest`: the area with the most PRs in its window wins.

The `threshold` strategy decides per roadmap and has no project-wide cadence. Let N be the PRs in a
roadmap's window and T the days since its last report landed (since its README was added, for one
never reported). A roadmap qualifies when N > 0 and one of these holds: N + T > `THRESHOLD`; it is
archived under `Completed/`; or it is not yet assessed (`assessment_gap`). A busy roadmap therefore
qualifies quickly and a quiet one after a while. Among those that qualify the unassessed go first,
then the largest N + T. The merge gate's per-roadmap interval (`gate.MIN_REPORT_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
is applied too, so the planner does not choose a report the gate would refuse.

    An open progress pull request marks its area in flight, but only for a while. One that the merge
    check refuses permanently never merges and never closes itself, and treating it as in flight
    forever would stop that roadmap being reported by *anyone*, including the maintainer, with no
    signal beyond the area quietly never appearing again. Past `stale_hours` it stops blocking and is
    reported as a note instead, so the next round covers the area over a wider window and the
    abandoned pull request becomes visible rather than merely obstructive.

    A pull request with no or unreadable `createdAt` keeps blocking. Age is the only evidence that it
    is stuck, and without it the safe assumption is that it is still in flight: opening a duplicate is
    worse than waiting.

    `owners` restricts whose pull requests may mark an area in flight, and defaults to the roadmap
    organisation plus this operator. Anyone may open a pull request on a `progress/*` branch, so
    without this a stranger could freeze a roadmap indefinitely by opening one a day -- staleness
    expiry bounds a single one, but not a stream of them. A stranger's report still merges
    on its own merits; it simply does not stop anyone else from writing one. The cost is that two
