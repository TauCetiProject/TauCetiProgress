"""Commit windows: turning a range of TauCeti history into the set of PRs it contains.

A window is the half-open commit range `(from_sha, to_sha]` on the docs-tracking branch (see
`CODE_REF`). `from_sha` is the previous section's `to_sha`, so consecutive windows tile exactly with
no gap and no overlap, and the identity of a window does not depend on anyone's clock.

Timestamps are used only for display and for the "is an update due" cadence, never as the cursor.
A cursor made of timestamps is wrong in a way that loses work silently: a worker whose clock runs
fast stores a cursor in the future, and PRs merged in the interval then carry merge times *before*
the stored cursor and are never reported by any later window.

Pure functions take text and lists; the two that shell out to `git` are marked.

# a link to it is guaranteed to resolve. Reporting against `main` would routinely name results whose
# documentation had not been built yet, and every such link would 404 until the next docs build.

# The cost is latency: a report describes the project as of the last published docs build rather than
# the tip. That is the right trade for a document whose whole purpose is to be readable, and the
# header records the exact commit either way, so nothing is misdated.
